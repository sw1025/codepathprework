Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Apps: 
1. Gmail: options to change between mailboxes or combine them, starred emails
2. YouTube: visual layout, home page has recommendations
3. rednote: visual layout, home page has recommendations

An app I would like to build is a study app with various smaller functionalities inside it. For example, there could be a timer, to-do list, music, and an option to lock the phone to the app for a certain period of time to avoid distractions.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had trouble with the button functionality at first because I didn't know I had to choose the Action option rather than Option. After making the Github folder and moving everything there, I had trouble making the build work, even though it worked before, and I didn't change anything.
